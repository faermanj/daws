# Simple S3 Automation

Write a program that uploads a pet picture to S3 and prints the object URL so that you can share it with your friends. You can use any language or tools you prefer for this exercice.

## Questionaire

* How much did it cost to publish the picture?
* How much it will cost for each friend that clicks the link?
* How could you protect your wallet?

## Don't Forget

Empty and delete the bucket after you are done.
