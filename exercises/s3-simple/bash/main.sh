# How to protect the bucket?
There are several ways to protect the bucket. We'll learn more about that as we progress, but here are some references:
* Use AWS Shield: https://aws.amazon.com/shield/
* Use temporary, signed URLs: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-signed-urls.html
* Use Amazon Cognito: https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/
